- I decided to take this class because I am interested in research using data science and applied math.

- What I most hope to learn is how to branch data science and physical science. While I have a good understanding of math and physical sciences branching the two together is not something I have much experience in.

- I have a background in applied math and have learned a lot of the math behind data science, which will be useful in making understanding the various data science techniques we are using.
