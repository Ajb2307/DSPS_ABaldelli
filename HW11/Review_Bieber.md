This updated plot from Ally reduces the ambiguity by changing scatter plot points to dashed lines that are more compact and overlap less. The individual curves are now easier to distinguish, rather than appearing jumbled on top of each other. The updates to the x and y-axis labels also helps lessen the ambiguity, although I think the plot could further benefit by also adding a title. The decision to make the curves follow the 'viridis' color map to convey a sense of numerical progression is a nice touch tht improves clarity and reduces ambiguity. I find that the jumbled look of the original plot with the random shapes was a little bit of a distraction, and the new plot alleviates this issue with the clean and compact dashed lines. The logarithmic scale on the x axis arguably distorts the graph, but I think that this is necessary to be able to properly see the influence of the smaller time gaps. Apart from this, there is not really any distortion to speak of in either the original or updated plots.

The new plot generally respects Tufte's 5 rules, with the possible exception of a "lie factor" from the log scale, but as mentioned, I think this can be forgiven. The data to ink ratio is about right, and the plot depicts a managable (less than 7) number of distinct curves. The original plot's usage of various colored shapes could arguably be considered chart junk, which has been eliminated in the updated version. The one drawback to this change is that the plot is likely no longer color-blind compliant. It may be difficult for a color-blind person to distinguish between the yellow and green dashed lines, for instance. Small multiples of time units (nanoseconds) are being leveraged, and the information to data dimension ratio seems about right.

I agree that this "bad" plot is overcrowded with information and creates a distraction. It is indeed ambiguous what is the primary information that the plot is trying to get across, and some information is covered up and nearly impossible to read. The color bar that seems to convey both flux and temperature is also ambiguous. I also agree that the inconsistent change in scale along both axis, as well as the depiction of "M/R=3" and "M/R^1.5=5" as straight dashed lines seems like an intentional distortion.

With respect to Tufte's 5 rules, the data vs ink ratio seems very much skewed towards ink. There are way more than 7 pieces of information depicted here. There are also definitely elements to the plot that can be considered chart junk, such as various unmarked dash lines and the labelled arrows, plus the inexplicable histogram along the right edge. With the smooth rainbow color gradient, I imagine that a color blind person would have an even harder time reading this plot than I do.
