This updated plot is much better. Switching from the overplotted scatterplot to dashed lines reduced ambiguity and distorition, making the plot much easier to read. Moving away from the log x axis and changing the axes labels also helps with ambiguity and makes the plot easier to interpret. The viridis colormap makes it color-blind compliant, which is also very good. In terms of Tufte's rules, the changes made improve the overall quality of the plot. Switching from the log x axis  improved the effect size because the visual spacing of the lines is now more proportional to the numerical spacing in the data. Replacing the dense scatterplot to the dotted lines increases the data/ink ratio. This also helps with the no chart junk rule, as overlapping points and  inconsistent colors were removed. Overall, the improvements make the plot much more cleaner and aligned with Tufte's rules.


# Bad Plot from Literature:

This plot has a very large amount of information, and is overly dense and cluttered, which makes it quite hard to interpret. The figure has too many arrows, text blocks, labels, overlapping colors and datapoints, background shadings, and has too many comparisons (densities, temperatures, flux, planet categories etc).
