## Good plot
 Each subplot clearly shows how different features change the wavelength of the model, labeling regions of particular interests.

## Bad plot
 This plot  is extremely chaotic looking, there is too much information and is over labeled to the point of distraction. The points are also at 100% opacity and over lapping making it so some information cannot be seen. This histogram on the side is confusing and I honestly have no clue what it is of. The scaling on the x and y axis seem erratic.
